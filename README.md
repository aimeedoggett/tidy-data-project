The run_analysis.R file uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset downloaded to a project folder in 
the working directory.  

This script will read and merge all experiment data to create a subset 
of all mean and standard deviation values combined with the activity (WALKING, SITTING, etc.) being performed and the subject identifier.
